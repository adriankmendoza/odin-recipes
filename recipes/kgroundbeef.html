      <img src="../images/kbeef.jpg" alt="beef" height="400" width="400">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a very fast and simple recipe, perfect for a weekday night. All that is needed
        is a handful of ingredients. This meal freezes very well also, making it the perfect candidate
    for meal prep!</p>
    <p>This is a korean dish, so by default it is a little spicy. Feel free to omit the red pepper.Fresh or
        ground ginger/garlic can be used, but will certainly yield a more delicious result.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 LB Ground Beef (80/20 gives the best flavor)</li>
        <li>1/4th Cup Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Crushed Red Pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Green Onion slices</li>
        <li>Toasted Sesame Seeds For Garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to create the sauce. Mix together br sugar, soy sauce, crushed red pepper,
            ginger, and toasted sesame oil. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Next, we want to cook the ground beef. Set your range to medium high and wait until it is hot. Once hot, 
            brown the ground beef for about 7-10 minutes. Once finished, drain.</li>
        <li>Now, grab the sauce you made from the first step, and heat it at about low. Feel free to add a corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce.</li>        
        <li>Once the sauce begins to lightly bubble, add the ground beef back to the pan. Let simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve on top of a bowl of steamed rice. Top off with sriracha, sesame seeds, and sliced green onion. Enjoy!</li>
