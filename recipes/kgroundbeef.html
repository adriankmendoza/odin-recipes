    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a very fast and simple recipe, perfect for a weekday night. All that is needed
        is a handful of ingredients. This meal freezes very well also, making it the perfect candidate
    for meal prep!</p>
    <p>This is a korean dish, so by default it is a little spicy. Feel free to omit the red pepper.Fresh or
        ground ginger/garlic can be used, but will certainly yield a more delicious result.</p>
